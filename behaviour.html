  <h3> <li>How the animal gets food</li> </h3>
  <p> Llamas are herbivores that primarily graze on grasses, herbs, and shrubs found in their natural habitat. They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough, fibrous vegetation.
    Llamas use their long necks and agile tongues to reach and consume vegetation at various heights.
